# Bioinformatics_Scripts
Scripts used during my analysis of seabird (i.e. Razorbills) Ion Torrent short sequence reads. These scripts will walk you through the processing and alignment of the reads, as well as calling and filtering variants for standard population genetics/genomics analysis. I have included scripts for running cutadapt, bowtie, samtools, bcftools, and vcftools.
